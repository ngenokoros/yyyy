    <b><i>Having a new friend to talk to</i> </b> feels like an
    <br>open question depends on a lot of fact
    <br>to do with impression may our knowing of each other be real and open
    <br> to anything coz we only human our nature tries to cop that of a chameleon only colors
    <br>
    come vivid  with time when we remember yesterday we were not
    <br> the color of tomorrow  as a friend when this happens remind me of
    <br>
    my fancy color u loved from me that is realness
